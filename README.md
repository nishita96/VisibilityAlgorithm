## On CPU

serially merging 

## On GPU 

parallely merging 


### Setup for CPU

- Install [https://openframeworks.cc/download/](#Openframeworks) 
- CPP development environment 
- Make project in it with the cloned repo

### Setup for GPU

- Install [https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/](#CUDA)
- CPP development environment 
- Clone the repo
- Build using make and Run

### Learning Objectives -->

[comment]: <> (This example is the simplest possible openFrameworks app! It does nothing. )

<!-- ...Well, *almost* nothing. Although it may not be apparent, the emptyExample activates all of the default system states. (For example, it sets the default fill color to white; it just doesn't happen to draw anything with it.)

The emptyExample is great for making sure that your openFrameworks development environment is compiling properly. It can also be useful as a "starter template" for making simple programs. 

The emptyExample will help you understand what are the bare necessities of an openFrameworks program. In this regard, you can think of it as a "Hello World" for OF.  -->


<!-- ### Expected Behavior

When launching this app, you should see a light-gray screen. 

* There's no interaction. 
* There's nothing to see. 
* That's it.  -->
